# Youth-Baseball
This Python program is designed to register players for youth baseball teams in a local league. Players are automatically assigned to a team based on their age.

Users input the name and age of each player. Once all players have been registered, it generates a report for each team, providing key details such as the total number of players on each team, the average age of players, and the youngest and oldest players. The report also includes a bulleted list of all team members along with their ages.

This program offers a simple and efficient way to register and organize players into teams, and provides a clear overview of the composition of each team.
